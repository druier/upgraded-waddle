# 🧠 Cache Poisoning Explained

Welcome to **Cache Poisoning Explained** – a repository that dives deep into one of the most misunderstood and impactful web application vulnerabilities: **Cache Poisoning**.

## 📌 What is Cache Poisoning?

**Cache Poisoning** is a type of attack where an attacker tricks a caching system (like CDN, reverse proxy, or browser cache) into storing a manipulated version of a resource. Future users requesting the same resource receive the malicious response from the cache instead of a legitimate one from the origin server.

This can lead to:

- Content spoofing
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- Authentication bypass
- Redirects to malicious sites

## 🔍 Attack Overview

1. The attacker crafts a malicious request with non-standard headers or URL parameters.
2. The server responds normally (reflecting part of the request), and the CDN or caching layer stores this response.
3. Future legitimate users are served the poisoned cache.
